# 🌍 Carbon Emission Forecasting & Trade Impact Analysis

> A capstone project that uses Machine Learning to forecast global CO₂ emissions and assess the impact of international trade on carbon output. Built using Python and Streamlit with real-world datasets.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Forecast CO₂ emissions using ML models (Random Forest, ARIMA, SHAP-based interpretable models)
- Analyze trade-emission relationships using Input-Output models
- Perform sector-wise carbon contribution analysis using EDGAR dataset
- Simulate policies and visualize scenarios through an interactive dashboard
